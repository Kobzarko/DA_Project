# Data Analysis: `Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset`

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing data from the `Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset` (Kaggle). It covers the complete data analysis workflow, from data loading and cleaning to visualization and business recommendations.

### Objectives:
1. Analyze the top 10 products by sales, revenue, and other metrics.
2. Use statistical methods to evaluate the impact of changes (e.g., price) on revenue.
3. Provide actionable recommendations to optimize business processes.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Import necessary libraries.
   - Load data from multiple CSV files.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Remove missing values.
   - Check and resolve duplicates.
   - Correct column names.
   - Convert data types (dates, numerical values, categories).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Calculate key metrics (number of unique customers, orders, etc.).
   - Build a correlation matrix for numerical columns.
   - Analyze sales trends by month.

4. **Product Category Analysis**
   - Identify weight, volume, and revenue for product categories.
   - Highlight the most profitable products.

5. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Conduct a t-test to evaluate the impact of price changes.
   - Analyze seasonal sales trends.

6. **Visualization**
   - Create graphs to analyze trends and key metrics.
   - Visualize sales dynamics for the top 10 products.
